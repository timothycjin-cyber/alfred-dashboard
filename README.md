## What It Does

Reads transaction data from a Google Sheet and visualises it in a clean mobile-first dashboard. No backend — fully static, runs in the browser.

**Home tab** — transaction timeline grouped by date, with daily spend totals and a net balance summary.

**Analytics tab** — cumulative spend chart (vs last month), category donut chart, burn rate, and end-of-month forecast.

## How Data Gets In

Transactions are logged via the **Alfred Telegram Bot** (separate repo) — send a text or receipt photo to the bot, and it writes a row to the Google Sheet automatically.

The dashboard reads from the sheet via Google's public GViz JSON endpoint (no authentication required).
